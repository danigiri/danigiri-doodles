Introduction
------------

Just testing code and having fun with some basic programming.
Attempting to write elegant and reasonably efficient code, exploiting recursivity whenever possible.

Problems tackled
----------------

* Longest palindrome (still pretty innefficient)
* Reverse polish notation calculator
* Merge sort of two lists and list sort
* Word Break: given a dictionary of words and a string, find out if the string can be composed exclusively from the words in the dictionary
* TODO: add rest of problems


Structures created
------------------

* Stack
* Linked List
* Queue
* Double Linked list
* Nary Tree
