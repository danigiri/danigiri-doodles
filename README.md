Introduction
------------

Just testing code and having fun with some basic programming.
Attempting to write elegant and reasonably efficient code, exploiting recursivity whenever possible.

Problems tackled
----------------

* Longest palindrome (still pretty innefficient, sorry)
* Reverse polish notation calculator
* Sorting: Merge sort, quick sort, bucket sort and heap sort 
* Word Break: given a dictionary of words and a string, find out if the string can be composed exclusively from the words in the dictionary
* Unique Chars: algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters
* Nth-Last: find the nth to last element of a singly linked list (0 is the last element)
* Min Stack: a stack that tells you the minimum element in the stack, all operations (including min are O(K))
* Longest 3-substring: longest consecutive 3 chars substring within a string
* Robot: find paths on NxN grids
* TODO: add rest of problems


Structures created
------------------

* Stack
* Graph
* Linked List
* Queue
* Double Linked list
* N-ary Tree
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* (Max)Heap
